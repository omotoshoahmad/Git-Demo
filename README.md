# THIS IS A PRACTICE FOR GITHUB VERSION CONTROL AND CODE STORAGE
I  am only using atom as a text editor, i found out that as one grew in this field your horizon continues to widen, just some months back i was entirely clueless on the ethos of data science and Machine learning and here i am today already using version control to manage my code.

Some might say it is serendipitous, but the goddess of luck only favors those who try, my tenets on this is that just do it, what=ever you wish to do, just do it.
